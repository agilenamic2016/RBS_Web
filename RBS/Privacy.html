            </p>

            <p>
                This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Platform and may be

                In this Privacy Policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a

            <h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
            <p>
                When you register with us through the Website or Applications to obtain services through the Platform, we
                may ask you for personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be
                used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”).
            </p>

            <p>
                Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your username, profile image, mobile phone number,
                credit card and other payment/billing information, email address, physical addresses and, if you wish,
                your friends’ email addresses (which we will only use in order to invite them to use the services
                available through the Platform).
            </p>

            <p>
                We may also collect information you supply to us regarding your personal preferences and interests. You
                can choose not to provide us with any or all of the information we specify or request, but then you may
                not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some or all of the features of the Platform. You
                can sign up to obtain services which are available through the Platform either on the Website or using
                the Applications.
            </p>

            <p>
                We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the services you have requested and administer your
                inquiries. We will create an account for you to use the Platform based upon the Personal Information you
                provide.
            </p>

            <p>
                We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information)
                mainly to provide the services you have requested through the Platform, complete your transactions, and
                administer your inquiries.
            </p>

            <p>
                Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were
                combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your postal code with your street address) in a
                way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying
                Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for
                example, your viewing preferences).
            </p>

            <p>
                We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with
                information collected from other users of the Platform to attempt to provide you with a better
                experience, to improve the quality and value of the services provided to you and to analyse and
                understand how the Platform and the services provided through the Platform are used. We may also use the
                combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product
                to you according to your preferences or restrictions.
            </p>

            <p>
                We may also use your Personal Information to send you newsletters, updates and marketing or promotional
                materials and other information which we think may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that
                you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions
                provided in any of the communications or update your “preferences” information. (See “Changing or
                Deleting Information” below.)
            </p>

            <h3>Log Data</h3>
            <p>
                When you visit the Platform, we may automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you
                visit a website or use the applications (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your
                Internet Protocol address, the browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to the
                Platform, pages of the Platform that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search
                for on the Platform, access times and dates, and other statistics. We may use this information to
                monitor and analyse use of the Platform and the services provided through the Platform, for the purpose
                of administration of the Platform, to increase the Platform’s functionality and user-friendliness, and
                to better tailor the Platform to our visitors’ needs.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Platform again, it may
                recognise you and serve advertisements and other information which it believes to be in line with your
                interests. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Platform meet the criteria
                required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in
                association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyse and evaluate such
                information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.
            </p>

            <h3>Device Information</h3>
            <p>
                In addition to Log Data, we may also collect information about the device you are using to access the
                Platform, including what type of device it is, what operating system you’re using, device settings,
                unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often
                depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. To learn more about what information your
                device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software
                provider
            </p>

            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                Like many websites and applications, the Platform uses “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a
                small data file that we transfer to your computer or mobile device’s hard disk for record-keeping
                purposes.
            </p>


            <p>
                We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilise persistent cookies to save your login information for
                future logins to the Platform. Second, we utilise session ID cookies to enable certain features of the
                Platform, to better understand how you interact with the Platform and to monitor aggregate usage by
                users of the Platform and web traffic routing on the Platform.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the
                Platform and close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Platform may also place or read cookies
                on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to
                prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however,
                you may not be able to use all portions of the Platform.
            </p>

            <h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
            <p>
                When you register on the Platform and submit Personal Information to create a profile or visual
                collection, other users of the Platform (including end users and services providers seeking to provide
                services through the Platform) may see your user name and profile image. If you choose to provide
                additional Personal Information in your profile, other users of the Platform (including end users and
                services providers seeking to provide services through the Platform) may see such additional Personal
                Information, including, but not limited to, your photograph, location, website, biography and personal
                preferences. Providing additional Personal Information is voluntary and should correlate with the degree
                of interaction you want to have with other users of the Platform (including end users and services
                providers seeking to provide services through the Platform). We recommend that you guard your sensitive
                information and not provide or upload any information which you do not want others to see, although you
                should be aware that if you choose to do this, you may not be able to register with us or to take
                advantage of some or all of the features of the Platform.
            </p>

            <p>
                We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise
                disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic
                profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your
                Personal Information.
            </p>

            <p>
                We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate the services available through the
                Platform, to provide such services, to perform Website and Application-related services (e.g., without
                limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Website and
                Application’s features) or to assist us in analysing how the Platform is used. These third parties may
                have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not
                to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
            </p>

            <p>
                We may use your Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information to comply with any contractual or
                other obligations, and arrangements for data sharing and information within our Company, our affiliates
                and related business companies and partners who provide administrative, professional advisory or other
                support services to us.
            </p>

            <p>
                We may share the information in your account (including your Personal Information) with the SNSs that you
                have linked to your account. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only for this
                purpose (unless the SNS has received your Personal Information independently of the Service) and are
                obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
            </p>

            <p>
                We may allow users to automatically post recent activity back to Facebook, and give them the option to
                disable Facebook Connect at any time by logging into their profile and selecting the option to disable
                Facebook Connect. Further, you may be able to edit your privacy settings for the content that you post
                which appears on Facebook by making selections in your “Edit Profile” settings on the Platform.
            </p>

            <p>
                We may cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply
                with any laws to which we and/or you may be subject. We may, in our sole discretion, disclose any
                information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we believe
                necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process, to protect our property (including
                intellectual property) and rights or a third party, to prevent, detect and investigate any crime,
                including fraud and any form of financial crime, analysing and managing of any financial risks, to
                protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or
                to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.
            </p>
